Quick and dirty IRC trivia bot.

It's my first time writing Python, so my code
will look ugly to more competent programmers.

----------------------------------------------

How-to guide

1. Get some questions and answers into the
   questions.txt file. See questions-spec.txt for
   details on the file format.

   The script import-moxquizz.py will import the 
   moxquizz question database into quizclown (for details, 
   see the comments in import-moxquizz.py).

2. Set up parameters (IRC server, port, channel, bot owner)
   by editing the first few lines of bot2.py

3. At the *nix shell, type
	$ ./run
