Quick and dirty IRC trivia bot.

It's my first time writing Python, so my code
will look ugly to more competent programmers.

How to set up quizclown

1. Get some questions and answers into the
   questions.txt file. See questions-spec.txt for
   details on the file format.

   The script import-moxquizz.py will import the 
   moxquizz question database into quizclown (for details, 
   see the comments in import-moxquizz.py).

2. Set up parameters (IRC server, port, channel, bot owner)
   by editing config.txt

3. At the *nix shell, type
	$ ./run
	
Updating quizclown

   Replace the *.py files in your quizclown directory
   with the latest ones from the quizclown repository,
   keeping your custom config.txt and questions.txt files
   intact.
