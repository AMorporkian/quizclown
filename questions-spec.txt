The first line of questions.txt names the source of the questions,
i.e. where they were taken from. The subsequent lines follow the
pattern:
	<question 1>
	<answer 1>
	    ...
	<question N>
	<answer N>

In the answer strings, a substring answer can be denoted using
# delimiters. For example, the question/answer lines

	What is this file ?
	The #specification#

will lead to both "The specification" and "specification" being
accepted as valid answers to the question "What is this file ?".
