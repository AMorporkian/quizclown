# Quick and dirty script to run the bot as 
# a daemon. Real daemons typically have more
# sophisticated, robust working than this, and
# can be configured to run automatically when
# you startup. (This is what I gather anyway.
# I'm not a sysadmin).
#
# I use the daemon command from
# http://libslack.org/daemon/.
# You have to put your quizclown directory
# in someplace owned by root for this to work.
# (I use /var/quizclown).
#
# You probably want to put some sort of configuration
# for the log rotator. On Linux, I make a file
# /etc/logrotate.d/quizclown and write in it:
# /var/log/quizclown {
#        daily
#        rotate 1
#        missingok
#        copytruncate
# }

daemon -D `pwd` -E /var/log/quizclown ./bot2.py
